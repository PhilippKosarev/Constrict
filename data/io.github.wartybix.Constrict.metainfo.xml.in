  <summary>Compress videos to target sizes</summary>
  <description>
    <p>Constrict compresses your videos to your chosen file size — useful for uploading to services with specific file size limits. No more relying on online services for video compression, or the manual trial-and-error of re-encoding at various bitrates yourself.</p>
    <p>Features include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>An intuitive, easy to use interface.</li>
      <li>Automatic calculation of average bitrate (ABR), resolution, framerate, and audio quality each video is re-encoded with to meet the target file size.</li>
      <li>Bulk compression of multiple videos to one output directory.</li>
      <li>Customization of framerate limits, to ensure a clearer or smoother image.</li>
      <li>A choice of codecs to encode output files with, including H.264, HEVC, AV1, and VP9.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The app attempts to retain as much audiovisual quality as possible for the file size given. However, extremely steep reductions in file size can cause significant loss of quality in the output file, and sometimes compression may not be possible at all. All processing is done locally — and as such, compression speeds are only as fast as your hardware allows.</p>

      <url type="details">https://github.com/Wartybix/Constrict/releases/tag/25.8</url>
      <description translate="no">
        <p>Lots of new features and improvements in this one:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Added hardware acceleration for significantly faster compression speeds. Only works if your GPU supports VA-API encoding for your chosen video codec, otherwise it'll fall back to regular software encoding. 'Extra Quality' mode will still use software encoding regardless.</li>
          <li>Added new app icon from the GNOME Design Team.</li>
          <li>Compressed videos now keep all their subtitle streams/languages, if the subtitles from video sources use compatible, text-only codecs.</li>
          <li>Fixed an issue where some trimmed video sources had much longer durations when compressed.</li>
          <li>Added Turkish translation.</li>
          <li>Updated existing translations.</li>
        </ul>

      <description translate="no">
        <p>A number of initial quality of life improvements and bug fixes in this release:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Corrected some SI units, such as 'MB' to 'MiB', and 'Kbps' to 'kbps'.</li>
          <li>Added Italian and Russian translations.</li>
          <li>Fixed unresponsiveness when clicking on an old notification from the app, or when attempting to open the app while it's already running.</li>
          <li>The app should generally require fewer attempts to compress videos now, and should no longer get caught up in endless loops going under/over target for some videos. Increased default tolerance to 25%.</li>
          <li>Fixed some instances of portrait videos being compressed to landscape.</li>
          <li>Fixed the app detecting the wrong frame rate from some source videos, and causing a crash.</li>
        </ul>
